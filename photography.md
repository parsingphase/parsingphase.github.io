Hi, I'm **Richard**, AKA parsingphase

I take photos as a hobby, and write code as a profession.

I've been a casual photographer for most of my life, starting with a [Disc Camera](https://clickamericana.com/media/photography/what-happened-to-kodak-disc-camera-debuted-in-1982) when I was about 10.
I got my first DSLR in about 2005, and it was a background hobby for a few years until lighter devices improved enough to take over and 
the DSLRs sat on the shelf for a while.

Roll forward to 2020, a relocation to Massachusetts and COVID precautions resulting in spending a lot of time indoors, watching migratory warblers in
the maple tree outside our apartment window. Incredibly, the 15-year-old hobbyist DLRs (Canon 350D and 400D, aka Digital Rebel XT and XTi) and cheap 70-300mm 
zoom still worked perfectly and got some decent (8 Megapixel) shots.

Then, just as the hobby was taking off again, I blew out the USB port, and got to remember the retro "joys" of downloading from a Compact Flash card
through a card reader. This was the tipping point to getting a new device - and wow, had they improved in 15 years. Shooting with a new Canon EOS 90D, 
first with a Sigma 100-400mm zoom and then a 150-600mm, handheld, was getting some real results and soon my wife (equipped with an EOS Digital Rebal T8i) 
and I were out shooting around once a week - and finding just how close to home wildlife can be found in Massachusetts.

This has proven to be more than just a hobby now - it's fresh air, it's family time, but it's also a great collection of images and memories
that are incredibly calming and satisfying to browse in a difficult year.

Many of these images - back to first picking up a DSLR - can be found at <br />

Some of the best recent wildlife images are collected in my <i class="fab fa-flickr"></i> [Wildlife Showcase](https://www.flickr.com/photos/parsingphase/albums/72157717026953392), mostly
under a <i class="fab fa-creative-commons"></i> [by-nc-nd](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/) license.

In addition to the images themselves, I've also given <i class="far fa-images"></i>
 [a talk on the topic](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g5wvf6jg6kpxwep/WildlifePhotographyWithPreamble.pdf)
 and written up <i class="fab fa-medium"></i>
[Some Notes on DSLR Wildlife Photography](https://medium.com/@parsingphase/some-notes-on-wildlife-photography-6370ea4f8965) for new photographers 
which have proven popular.
